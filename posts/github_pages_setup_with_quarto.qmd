    Setting up a Quarto website is not trivial.
    Here is my setup to publish a single github repository using the www.gandi.net DNS.

# Desired setup

Setting up a Quarto website on github pages is fairly straightforward: [you just need to follow the docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)!
In my case though, I want to do something slightly more complex because I want multiple github pages websites:

- one for my personal website (on which you are right now).
- one for my other Quarto projects. For each one, I want to have an associated github pages which can serve as a demo or readme.

Furthermore, I want the personnal website to use the root URL `www.guillaumedehaene.com` while I want project pages to use the default `guillaumedehaene.github.io/project_name/`.

These requirements are summarized in @fig-setup.

    E[Project B] --> F[guillaumedehaene.github.io/project_b]
```

# Steps

## Standard deploy to github pages

### Quarto configuration

First, we need a Quarto website.
I have decided that I will render the website on my machine, and that github will just serves the files once they are uploaded ([corresponding to this section of the docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#render-to-docs)).

Thus, we just change the global website configuration so that `quarto render` compiles to the `docs` folder:

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
    type: website
    output-dir: docs
```

### github configuration

Now, we need to setup github:

- add a `.nojekyll` file at the root of repository.
- create a new github repository **with the specific repository name** `USERNAME.github.io`.
    - normally, github associates `USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME` to a given repository.
    - if we use this special repository name, github uses the root URL `USERNAME.github.io`.
- push the project to the remote repository.
- go to settings >> pages and tell github pages to publish from the `docs` folder on the `main` branch.

At this point, `guillaumedehaene.github.io` is fully functional.

## Custom domain for github page

### Quarto configuration

We will make it so that the website answers to my custom url `www.guillaumedehaene.com`.

First, we need to tell Quarto about the custom url:

- create a `cname` file at the project root containing the custom url:

    ```{filename="cname"}
    www.guillaumedehaene.com
    ```

- modify the project configuration file: `_quarto.yml` to include the cname file and so that Quarto uses the custom url:

    ```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
    project:
        # publishing to github pages
        # ref: https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#render-to-docs
        type: website
        output-dir: docs
        resources:
            - CNAME

    website:
        title: "Guillaume Dehaene"
        site-url: www.guillaumedehaene.com
    ```

- render and push to github.

### Gandi DNS configuration

We will configure the DNS server so that it knows to serve the custom url to the right github pages url.

On gandi, I get to set the DNS configuration manually.

```
@ 10800 IN SOA ns1.gandi.net. hostmaster.gandi.net. 1711531617 10800 3600 604800 10800
@ 1800 IN A 185.199.108.153
@ 1800 IN A 185.199.109.153
@ 1800 IN A 185.199.110.153
@ 1800 IN A 185.199.111.153
www 10800 IN CNAME guillaumedehaene.github.io.
```

NB: [the IP addresses are documented on this page of the github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain).

I'm honestly a bit confused about exactly what is going on under the hood here, but as far as I can tell:

- the first four lines set the binding between the root domain `guillaumedehaene.com` and my github page.
- the fifth line sets the binding specifically for the `www` subdomain.

### github configuration

Finally, we tell github about the cname:

- go to settings >> pages and tell github pages to use a `Custom domain` and specify your desired full domain
- wait a day, then enable https
